## Module Control.Applicative

#### `Applicative`

``` purescript
class (Apply f) <= Applicative f  where
  pure :: forall a. a -> f a
```

The `Applicative` type class extends the [`Apply`](#apply) type class
with a `pure` function, which can be used to create values of type `f a`
from values of type `a`.

Where [`Apply`](#apply) provides the ability to lift functions of two or
more arguments to functions whose arguments are wrapped using `f`, and
[`Functor`](#functor) provides the ability to lift functions of one
argument, `pure` can be seen as the function which lifts functions of
_zero_ arguments. That is, `Applicative` functors support a lifting
operation for any number of function arguments.

Instances must satisfy the following laws in addition to the `Apply`
laws:

- Identity: `(pure identity) <*> v = v`
- Composition: `pure (<<<) <*> f <*> g <*> h = f <*> (g <*> h)`
- Homomorphism: `(pure f) <*> (pure x) = pure (f x)`
- Interchange: `u <*> (pure y) = (pure (_ $ y)) <*> u`

##### Instances
``` purescript
Applicative (Function r)
Applicative Array
Applicative Proxy
```

#### `liftA1`

``` purescript
liftA1 :: forall f a b. Applicative f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

`liftA1` provides a default implementation of `(<$>)` for any
[`Applicative`](#applicative) functor, without using `(<$>)` as provided
by the [`Functor`](#functor)-[`Applicative`](#applicative) superclass
relationship.

`liftA1` can therefore be used to write [`Functor`](#functor) instances
as follows:

```purescript
instance functorF :: Functor F where
  map = liftA1
```

#### `unless`

``` purescript
unless :: forall m. Applicative m => Boolean -> m Unit -> m Unit
```

Perform an applicative action unless a condition is true.

#### `when`

``` purescript
when :: forall m. Applicative m => Boolean -> m Unit -> m Unit
```

Perform an applicative action when a condition is true.


### Re-exported from Control.Apply:

#### `Apply`

``` purescript
class (Functor f) <= Apply f  where
  apply :: forall a b. f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

The `Apply` class provides the `(<*>)` which is used to apply a function
to an argument under a type constructor.

`Apply` can be used to lift functions of two or more arguments to work on
values wrapped with the type constructor `f`. It might also be understood
in terms of the `lift2` function:

```purescript
lift2 :: forall f a b c. Apply f => (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
lift2 f a b = f <$> a <*> b
```

`(<*>)` is recovered from `lift2` as `lift2 ($)`. That is, `(<*>)` lifts
the function application operator `($)` to arguments wrapped with the
type constructor `f`.

Put differently...
```
foo =
  functionTakingNArguments <$> computationProducingArg1
                           <*> computationProducingArg2
                           <*> ...
                           <*> computationProducingArgN
```

Instances must satisfy the following law in addition to the `Functor`
laws:

- Associative composition: `(<<<) <$> f <*> g <*> h = f <*> (g <*> h)`

Formally, `Apply` represents a strong lax semi-monoidal endofunctor.

##### Instances
``` purescript
Apply (Function r)
Apply Array
Apply Proxy
```

#### `(<*>)`

``` purescript
infixl 4 apply as <*>
```

#### `(<*)`

``` purescript
infixl 4 applyFirst as <*
```

#### `(*>)`

``` purescript
infixl 4 applySecond as *>
```

### Re-exported from Data.Functor:

#### `Functor`

``` purescript
class Functor f  where
  map :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

A `Functor` is a type constructor which supports a mapping operation
`map`.

`map` can be used to turn functions `a -> b` into functions
`f a -> f b` whose argument and return types use the type constructor `f`
to represent some computational context.

Instances must satisfy the following laws:

- Identity: `map identity = identity`
- Composition: `map (f <<< g) = map f <<< map g`

##### Instances
``` purescript
Functor (Function r)
Functor Array
Functor Proxy
```

#### `void`

``` purescript
void :: forall f a. Functor f => f a -> f Unit
```

The `void` function is used to ignore the type wrapped by a
[`Functor`](#functor), replacing it with `Unit` and keeping only the type
information provided by the type constructor itself.

`void` is often useful when using `do` notation to change the return type
of a monadic computation:

```purescript
main = forE 1 10 \n -> void do
  print n
  print (n * n)
```

#### `(<$>)`

``` purescript
infixl 4 map as <$>
```

#### `(<$)`

``` purescript
infixl 4 voidRight as <$
```

#### `(<#>)`

``` purescript
infixl 1 mapFlipped as <#>
```

#### `($>)`

``` purescript
infixl 4 voidLeft as $>
```
